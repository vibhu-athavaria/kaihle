**AI-powered learning infrastructure for schools and families**

## Overview

Kaihle is an AI-driven learning platform that helps schools deliver **personalized, curriculum-aligned education** while reducing teacher workload.

Kaihle handles curriculum structuring, adaptive learning paths, and continuous assessment so that **teachers can focus on mentorship** and schools can spend more time on life skills, creativity, and real-world learning.

The platform can be used by:
- **Schools** (as a core learning engine for teachers)
- **Parents/Families** (as a guided learning system with mentor oversight)

## The Problem

Modern education struggles with:
- Heavy teacher workload from lesson planning
- One-size-fits-all pacing for diverse learners
- Limited time for life skills and experiential learning
- Fragmented tools that don’t adapt to individual students

Existing LMSs manage content, but they do not **personalize learning at scale**.
